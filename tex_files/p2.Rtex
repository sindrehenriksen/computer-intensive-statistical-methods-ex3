\paragraph{(1.)}
The data used in this problem is the '\textit{bilirubin.txt}' data set. It contains bilirubin levels in the blood of three different persons. It is imported in the code below and we used \texttt{ggplo2} from the \textbf{tidyverse}-package to create the plots.

A box plot of the \textit{bilirubin} data set is shown in Figure \ref{fig:boxplot_bili}. This shows that values from person 'p1' is almost the same as for person 'p2', but is diverging for person 'p3'.

We did a linear regression using the function \texttt{lm} from \textbf{R} to fit the linear model
\begin{equation*}
    log(\matr{Y}_{ij}) = \beta_i + \epsilon_{ij};\enspace i = 1, 2, 3, \enspace j = 1, ..., n_i, \enspace \epsilon_{ij}\overset{\mathrm{iid}}{\sim} \N(0,\sigma^2).
    \label{eq:linmod2}
\end{equation*}
We want to do a F-test on the hypothesis $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = \beta_3$, which is done by the hypothesis test
\begin{equation}
    \begin{array}{rl}
        H_0: & \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \beta_3 \\
        H_1: & \beta_1 \neq \beta_2 \neq \beta_3.
    \end{array}
    \label{eq:ftest}
\end{equation}
The code for the linear regression is shown under. We get the F-statistics of the observed data $F_{\mathrm{obs}}$ from the \texttt{summary.lm} function and we store it in \texttt{Fval}. Using the F-distribution to calculate the p-value, $p\mathrm{-value} = 0.039$, or using just the F-value, if we chose a significance level of $5\%$, the hypothesis wouldn't be accepted.

\paragraph{(2.)}
In the \texttt{permTest} function a data frame of the \textit{bilirubin} data is the only input. It creates a temporary data frame and then changes the order of the grouping in the \texttt{\$pers} column, to create a permutation of the data. Then with the same method used in question \textbf{1.}, we calculate and return the F-statistic.

\paragraph{(3.)}
We are now ready to implement a permutation test using the function created in question \textbf{2.}, with $N = 999$ different permutations. The returned F-statistics $F_i; i\in[1,N]$ can then be used to calculate the p-value of the F-test shown in Equation \eqref{eq:ftest}. The p-value is calculated by the equation
\begin{equation*}
    \textrm{p-value} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^N I(F_i>=F_{\textrm{obs}})}{N},
\end{equation*}
where $I(A) = 1$ if $A$ is true and $0$ otherwise. A histogram of the F-statistics from the permutations is shown in Figure \ref{fig:his_fstat}. Here one can see that most of the F-values are to the left of the red line, which is the F-value of the bilirubin data found in question \textbf{1.}. Since most of the points are to the left of the line this is a strong indication of a small p-value. Our implementation of the permutation test is shown below, and the p-value is printed.

The $p\mathrm{-value} = 0.041$, which is as expected from looking at Figure \ref{fig:his_fstat}, small. If we chose a significance level of $5\%$ the hypothesis wouldn't be accepted, which means that the \textit{bilirubin} levels for the three different persons, are of different distributions.
